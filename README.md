I'm James Bruder, a junior Computer Science Engineering major at UConn. 
I've worked with Python, C, Arduino, web languages like HTML and PHP, Java, etc.
I've always been developing personal projects in my free time, using my knowledge of CAD, electronics, and programming.
On my Github I have repos from hackathons and will continue to add my projects on here. 
I plan on starting to use git for version control for all of my projects.
