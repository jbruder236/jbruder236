I'm James Bruder, a senior Computer Science Engineering student at UConn. 
I've taken classes in Python, C, C++, Java, and web languages like HTML, PHP, CSS.
I've always been developing personal projects in my free time, using my knowledge of CAD, electronics, and programming.
I make frequent use of Arduino microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi SBCs.
On my Github I have repos for hackathons, coursework, and personal projects.
