Hey!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science Engineering alum @ UConn '23.

I worked as a Software Engineer @ Naiad Dyanmics for a couple years after undergrad - contributing to large C repositories for embedded control systems and developing a touchscreen UI application w/ Qt and C++.

Lots of exposure to Linux - configuring systemd services, writing tons of bash scripts, reading system journals, just generally maintaining the debian images for our main controller and touchscreen display (both ARM based).

I've always been developing personal projects in my free time, using my knowledge of CAD, electronics, and programming.

Got a few 80's/90's cars and motorcycles that I work on in my free time. Just bought an '05 RV with my girlfriend to travel the US for a little while in between jobs.
